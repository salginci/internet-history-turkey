Background Research on the History of the Internet in Turkey
The history of the internet in Turkey spans several key developments, from its early introduction in the 1990s to widespread broadband adoption and the rise of mobile connectivity. This section outlines major milestones, government policies, and the impact of the internet on Turkish society.
Early Internet in Turkey (1993-2000)
1993: The first internet connection in Turkey was established at Middle East Technical University (METU) via the NSFNET (National Science Foundation Network) in the USA.
1996: The first commercial ISPs (Internet Service Providers) emerged, such as Superonline and TTNet.
1997: The Turkish government established TR-Net, providing infrastructure for universities and research centers.
Late 1990s: Dial-up internet became available for the public, but high costs and slow speeds limited adoption.
Broadband Expansion and Public WiFi (2000-2010)
2000: ADSL (Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line) technology was introduced, replacing dial-up and offering faster speeds.
2005: TTNet became the dominant ISP in Turkey.
2006: Public WiFi hotspots began appearing in major cities such as Istanbul and Ankara.
2008: Fiber-optic infrastructure projects were launched, improving connectivity across the country.
Rise of Mobile Internet and Digital Economy (2010-Present)
2010: 3G networks became widespread, significantly increasing mobile internet adoption.
2016: 4.5G technology was introduced, enhancing mobile broadband speeds.
2022: Turkey began testing 5G networks, with nationwide implementation planned.
Today: The internet is an integral part of Turkish daily life, supporting e-commerce, social media, and digital streaming platforms.

Google Cloud Run for deployment
Github for repository.
Docker 


Users . co-workers are used for feedbacks and test. In addition
